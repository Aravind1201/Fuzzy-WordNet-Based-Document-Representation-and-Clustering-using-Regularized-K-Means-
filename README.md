# Fuzzy-WordNet-Based-Document-Representation-and-Clustering-using-Regularized-K-Means-
A framework that focuses on document clustering using a combination of Fuzzy WordNet and Regularized K - Means algorithm.

These days, sources such as the internet and digital libraries contribute to a mountain of text. Managing textual information in accordance with user needs is becoming increasingly important as textual data continues to grow. Document clustering is a method for organising massive amounts of text data into manageable chunks. To solve the problems of polysemantic ambiguity and synonymousness that plague current methods, this research introduces a robust framework that employs WordNet to guarantee text homology. Once again, Fuzzy WordNet is employed as the basis for the document representation in order to enhance the document clustering performance. K-means, the simplest clustering technique, is used to group similar text texts together. The traditional k-means clustering approach has the drawback of include all variables in the analysis, regardless of whether or not they contribute to the clustering pattern. This is unsatisfactory in high-dimensional cluster evaluation. By adding an adaptive group LASSO penalty term to the cluster vertices, k-means clustering can be regularised. The proposed methodology enhances clustering performance.
